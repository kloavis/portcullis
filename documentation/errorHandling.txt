This document specifies how application errors should be handled internally and reported to clients.

Error returned to clients:
     Any externally reported errors shall be reported in an http response.  The server shall send a json
     dictionary response, containing the type of error (such as "Error" or "Warning", the exception thrown, 
     as well as an explanatory message.

     In addition, the server shall send the json data with status 5xx and message.  The 5xx code shall be greater
     than 505, and shall correspond to a specific exception or class of exceptions.  In this way a client
     device need not render the json data to understand and handle the error.

     HTTP Status definitions:
     	  To be determined.

Internal Exception handling:
     Externally reported errors shall use custom Exceptions that have a descriptive name and message.
     The custom exceptions shall be defined in /portcullis/customExceptions.py
     The exceptions should be caught in views and reported via the http response described above.
