Why is Portcullis cool?

Portcullis is an application designed to centralize all kinds of data that can be collected from network connected sensor devices. Devices send data to a Portcullis server through an HTTP-based API. Once on the server, the data can be analyzed and visualized using a variety of fancy techiques.
